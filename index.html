    <h1>Fun Kitten Facts!</h1>
	<P>The Young of Domesticated Cats Are “Kittens”, Not “Cubs”. Of course you knew that!</P>
	<P>There are usually 2-5 kittens in a litter, and they are born at 30-45 minute intervals. Some are born head first, much like human babies, but others come out feet first.</P>
	<P>Newborn Kittens Are Completely Helpless. Kittens are born with tightly sealed eyes and ears, and for several weeks they spend their time sleeping and nursing. At this point, young kittens can’t even defecate or urinate without being stimulated by their mother! </P>
	<P>Kittens Socialize in Order to Learn. Kittens learn through play, so all of the climbing, scampering, biting, stalking, meowing and so on emulates actions they will need to know as older cats.</P>
